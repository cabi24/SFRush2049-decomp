Processed:
- Ran parse_ollama_output.py extract-symbols/clean-c/summary and produced cleaned outputs in ollama_analysis/.
- Replaced extract-symbols output with a deduped, meaningful set in ollama_analysis/extracted_symbols.txt.
- Cleaned C snippets into ollama_analysis/extracted_c_code.txt with headers and noted incomplete/missing bodies.
- Generated ollama_analysis/summary.txt from parser.

Issues/notes:
- Many Ollama pseudo-C snippets are corrupted or missing; extracted_c_code.txt flags which need full re-decomp.
- batch3_decompiled.txt is absent in the repo, so no batch3 snippets were processed; rerun tools if it’s added.
- Per instructions, symbol_addrs.us.txt was not modified.

Functions needing human review:
- All priority and batch2 functions listed in extracted_c_code.txt (game_loop, game_update, attract, render_object/render_scene/audio_control/input_handler, countdown/preplay, render_large, audio_processing, vehicle_physics, collision_check, physics_calc/helper, race_logic, screen_update, state_helper, race_helper, checkpoint_check, track_logic) require proper decomp or validation beyond the Ollama output.
