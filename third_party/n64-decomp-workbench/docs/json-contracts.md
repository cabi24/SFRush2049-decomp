# JSON and automation contracts

Every command with `--json` returns exactly one JSON document on stdout.
Success documents carry a versioned top-level `schema`; failures carry
`decomp-workbench-error-v1`. Diagnostics are not mixed into stderr in JSON
mode, so a caller never has to guess whether stdout is parseable.

## Success

Schemas name the user-visible report, for example:

- `decomp-workbench-comparison-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-staleness-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-diagnosis-v3`
- `decomp-workbench-lever-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-campaign-status-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-campaign-finish-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-oracle-sweep-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-trace-source-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-relocation-proof-v1`
- `decomp-workbench-target-readiness-v1`

### Hash-bound promotion and campaign state

Artifact records use resolved `path`, descriptive `role`, byte `size`, and
lowercase `sha256`. Content is identity: modification time is not recorded.
Consumers should not infer source/object causality from two adjacent records;
the relocation proof states that relation as `host-declared` because it does
not run the build.

`reloc-surface --identity-provider` retains the ordinary
`decomp-workbench-reloc-surface-v1` host schema and adds an `identities`
sub-document named `decomp-workbench-relocation-identity-report-v1`. Site
statuses are exactly `resolved`, `unknown`, and `contradicted`; `complete=true`
means a non-empty site set is wholly resolved with no contradiction.

`reloc-proof` emits `decomp-workbench-relocation-proof-v1`. Its
`surfaces.fallback_static` and `surfaces.promoted_linked` members are separate
claims. A newly built receipt has `status=PASS`; verification adds
`verification=AGREES|DISAGREES`, boolean `pass`, and the recorded/rebuilt
documents. Static synthesis, the project identity join, and linked byte
classification are recomputed from the hash-bound inputs; linked range
coordinates must agree with a bound `range-map` artifact. Verification errors
on stale, cropped, or internally fabricated input rather than returning
agreement over a different file.

Candidate lifecycle reports are
`decomp-workbench-campaign-checkpoint-v1`,
`decomp-workbench-campaign-restore-v1`, and
`decomp-workbench-campaign-accept-v1`. Candidate artifacts use
`decomp-workbench-candidate-artifact-v1`; contextual manifest pointers use
`decomp-workbench-candidate-pointer-v1`. This separation lets current and best
point at the same immutable content while retaining different roles,
comparison evidence, and origin paths. `same` is true only when both were
supplied and their content IDs agree.

Campaign dossier JSONL uses one `decomp-workbench-dossier-entry-v1` object per
line; the query report is `decomp-workbench-dossier-v1`. IDs are SHA-256
prefixes over substantive canonical fields and are checked on read. A torn
final line is a warning; malformed or edited completed lines are errors.

`campaign readiness` consumes `decomp-workbench-target-queue-v1` and emits
`decomp-workbench-target-readiness-v1`. Class values are exactly
`promotion-ready`, `codegen-ready`, `identity-maintenance`, and `remeasure`.
`source_queue`, `maintenance_queue`, and `promotion_queue` are derived lists,
not additional classifications. Every measurement has an `artifact_sha256`
role-to-digest map binding at least one target-side and one candidate-side
artifact; adjacent but unbound current files do not make a measurement fresh.

PRE reports use `decomp-workbench-pre-trace-v1` or
`decomp-workbench-pre-diff-v1`; the guarded adapter emits
`decomp-workbench-pre-instrument-v1`. Scheduler provenance is additive inside
`decomp-workbench-scheduler-trace-v1`: `emitted_slot`, `source_file`,
`source_statement`, `reason`, and `ready_ids`, plus report-level
`provenance_complete`. A complete event has every field, exactly `ready`
unique IDs, and its `chosen` ID in that set; partial or contradictory sets are
never counted as complete.

### One command, two shapes

Two commands take more than one candidate, and the schema says which shape you
got. Switch on `schema`, never on argument count:

| Command | One candidate | Several candidates |
|---|---|---|
| `align`, `align-dumps` | `decomp-workbench-shift-diff-v1` | `decomp-workbench-align-census-v1` |
| `phase`, `phase-dumps` | `decomp-workbench-phase-v1` | `decomp-workbench-phase-census-v1` |

A census document holds one single-candidate report per entry under
`candidates`, so a consumer that already reads the single shape can loop over
that list unchanged.

### Sub-documents never rename their host

Optional blocks merged into a report keep their keys namespaced and name
themselves under a prefixed key, never `schema`. `--watch-rows` adds
`watch_rows`, `watch_signature`, the tallies, and `watch_schema`
(`decomp-workbench-watch-rows-v1`) to a `compare`, `rank`, or `sweep build`
document; the document's own top-level `schema` is unchanged. `compare`,
`compare-dumps`, `diagnose` and `diagnose-dumps` add `staleness` and
`staleness_schema` (`decomp-workbench-staleness-v1`) the same way: what was
compared, when each artifact was built, and any input newer than the build
that was compared against it. `check-staleness` emits that document on its
own, with the schema at the top level. Its `status` is `fresh` only when at
least one input/derived pair was actually read: a comparison run without
`--built-from` compared nothing, so it reports `unknown` with `comparisons: 0`
rather than certifying a build nobody checked. Switch on
`schema` to know what you are holding, and on the presence of the prefixed
keys to know which optional blocks came with it.

### The lever block

`diagnose` and `diagnose-dumps` add `lever` and `lever_schema`
(`decomp-workbench-lever-v1`) whenever the comparison is not exact. An exact
comparison has no residual to explain and carries neither key, so the presence
of the block is itself the statement that something is left.

`lever_class` is exactly one of `stack-home`, `temp-ring`, `line-order`,
`pool-population`, `pool-rotation`, `unreachable`, and `none-known`. Beside
it, `edit_family`, `edit` and `citation` name the concrete source edit and the
function and date it was measured on; `evidence` is the lines that support the
class; `measurements` carries the numbers it was computed from;
`alternatives` lists the sibling families in the class, each with the
`discriminator` that would select it instead; `see_also` lists catalogue
proofs the owning pass points at; `reachability` reports a recorded force
experiment and is null without one.

**`edit_family` is null whenever the input that would name it is absent, and
`needs` then names the capture that produces it.** That pairing is the
contract, not a convenience: a consumer that treats a named class as a named
edit will act on a guess. `edit` and `citation` travel with `edit_family` and
are null with it.

`stack-home` is the one class whose family comes from the disassembly rather
than from a trace, so a `stack-home` lever always names a family, and a `needs`
beside it asks for the frame ladder that *corroborates* the count rather than
for the input that produced the family. It ranks its three directions in the
order `STACK_HOME_RANKING` states: an unequal **pool lane** first — the side
carrying the surplus web names the direction, because a value one side colours
and the other homes is a declaration-list fact — then the frame delta, then the
number of displaced homes. For every other class the family is read from a
trace and `edit_family` stays null until one is supplied.

`temp-ring` needs two inputs, not one, and names a family only when both are
present. `--ring-trace` says which line was charged a pop; `--source` says what
that line contains, and `measurements.constructs_by_line` reports it as
`field-through-local`, `scaled-index`, `fused-accumulate`, `constant`, or
`unclassified`. Each pop-cost rule was measured on one construct, so a charged
line that holds none of the first three yields no family and a `reason` naming
the construct it does hold. A pop count says which line to edit; it does not
say which law reaches it.

`pool-rotation` and `pool-population` are decided by comparing the two pool
lanes' **lengths** before anything else. Unequal lengths are
`pool-population`: one side colours a web the other leaves in the temp ring,
and no colour lever reaches a web that does not exist. Equal lengths make the
residual a rotation, and then `measurements.owning_sweep` names which sweep
coloured its registers — `p1`, `p2`, `mixed`, or null when the capture holds
no coloured web on any of them. That field is null without `--ladder`, because
p1 and p2 order their webs differently and nothing in two disassemblies says
which owns a colour.

With a capture, `measurements` also carries `tie_group` (the save and the
members, for a p1 pair ordered by web number alone), `move_earlier` and
`move_later`, and `involved_webs`. The direction is derived from the
lowest-free-colour rule, which the records establish for **p2** only, so it is
stated for a p2 pair and never for a p1 one, and only for a two-register
transposition with exactly one coloured web on each side. It is a reading of
the numbering rule rather than a measured lever: no recorded edit has yet
reordered a pair. A register held by two coloured webs names no
direction and `needs` asks for `CDX_DETAIL_WEB` instead. **A named
renumbering family always carries a `needs` entry demanding a confirming
second capture**: an edit chosen from the numbering model can leave every web
number where it was, and the source diff cannot show that.

`reachability` is `proven`, `unreachable`, or null, and it is a statement
about the web graph rather than about the source. `proven` means a recorded
`CDX_FORCE` run in `--force-result` reached `words=0`: every colour in the
residual is legal and the pass added no instruction, so what is missing is a
spelling. `unreachable` means the pass declined a force or bought it with
extra instructions. A run that neither closed nor failed leaves the field
null and reports the best residual as evidence, because a force that improved
the count proves nothing about the rest.

`unreachable` is null unless the class is `unreachable`; when present it
carries `unreachable_class` (`as1-readiness`, `uopt-address-folding`,
`uopt-coalescing-tie-break`, or `cfe-pointer-add-order`), the `proof`, its
`citation`, `reopens_when` — the condition under which the target is worth
another look — and `precondition`, the residual shape the proof was measured
on.

A catalogue proof is the **verdict** whenever the evidence at hand meets that
precondition, not a footnote beside `none-known`. Two do:
`as1-readiness` from an `--as1-trace` whose selections are all decided above
the line key, and `uopt-coalescing-tie-break` when the colourer owns the
residual and it is one consistent web substitution across its sites between
argument and return registers — the tie the proof is about, and narrower than
"one web", which any pass can produce. The
remaining two describe shapes two disassemblies cannot distinguish, so they
stay under `see_also` with their `precondition` for the reader to check.
Every entry under `see_also` carries that sentence for the same reason.

`decomp-workbench commands --json` is the versioned discovery surface. Existing
flat command names and journey spellings return the same report:
`object diagnose` is an alias of `diagnose`, and `campaign status` is an alias
of `campaign-status`. Each discovery entry includes executable `invocation`
argv, its `report_schema`, and conservative safety metadata (`default`,
`external_process`, `network`, and `destructive`). The metadata describes the
default path; command help remains authoritative for optional output flags.

The report also carries a top-level `network` object: the offline-first
`policy` sentences, the `commands` that may open a connection, and the `hosts`
they contact with the reason for each. It is an inventory, not a flag — an
empty `commands` list is the positive claim that this build cannot call out,
and every command outside the list reports `safety.network: false`. Use it as
the egress contract; do not infer network behavior from a command's name.

`next --json` is the action surface. Every proposed step carries
`command_argv`, a shell-rendered `command` for humans, `safety`, and an
`expected_signal` that says what evidence would make the step informative.
Agents should execute argv directly and evaluate the expected signal instead
of scraping prose or invoking a shell string.

Comparison metric labels, JSON keys, census keys, and ledger fields share one
registry. Run:

```sh
decomp-workbench --explain-keys
```

Canonical short keys such as `words`, `aligned_total`, and `frame` are the
stable vocabulary. Deprecated long spellings remain emitted only for the
documented compatibility window.

Rank reports name the selected scale as `ranked_by`. If any candidate required
alignment gaps, `alignment_ranking_unsafe=true` and the whole set is ordered on
positional `words`; two gapped candidates are not assumed to share an aligned
scale. `mixed_alignment` is retained as the narrower fact that both gap-free
and gapped candidates were present.

`diagnose`/`diagnose-dumps` emit `decomp-workbench-diagnosis-v3` and
`view`/`view-dumps` emit `decomp-workbench-view-v3`. Both bumps are additive.
v2 gained a `routing` field beside the verdict; v3 gained `owning_pass`,
`reachability` and `ownership_basis` beside that. Nothing was removed or
renamed at either step, so a consumer that ignores the new fields reads a v3
document exactly as it read a v1 one.

`routing` is one of `permuter-first`, `structural`, `import-fix`, or `none` --
which tool the residual belongs to, as opposed to which mechanism explains it.
An allocation, colour, or schedule tie is always `permuter-first`; it is never
reported as proven unmatchable.

`owning_pass` is one of `cfe-spelling`, `rodata-load-form`,
`stack-home-assignment`, `uopt-globalcolor`, `ugen-temp-ring`, `g0-scheduler`,
`none` (an exact pair) or `unknown` (nothing here settles it). `reachability`
is one of `source-reachable`, `permuter-target`, `pass-owned` or `unknown`.
`ownership_basis` says what those two were read off and is never omitted:
`trace` when a compiler trace settled it, `heuristic` when they were read off
the residual's shape, `none` when there was nothing to read. A consumer that
treats a `heuristic` answer as a measurement is making the claim the field
exists to prevent.

`pass-owned` means the evidence exposes no handle a source edit reaches. It is
**not** a wall: a `pass-owned` residual routes `permuter-first` exactly like
any other tie, and the measurement that may record a wall is
`permute classify`, afterwards.

On a diagnosis the top-level `routing`, `owning_pass` and `reachability` may
differ from `view.*`: a relocation naming a different symbol makes the whole
residual `import-fix`/`unknown`/`unknown` while the view still reports the
mechanism it measured.

Experiment-v2 and endgame additions are additive to existing report schemas:

- comparisons expose `aligned_row_receipts`, a code-free row identity/class/
  equality table used by signals;
- campaign results expose `signals`, `object_sha256`, and `controls`;
- campaign status exposes `acceptance_trajectory`, `mechanism_trajectory`,
  `coverage`, `conclusion_label`, requested `rank_by`, effective `ranked_by`,
  and `alignment_ranking_unsafe`;
- scratch checks expose `truth_layers`, `context_differential`,
  `context_hypotheses`, and optional `project_comparison`;
- finish files use `decomp-workbench-campaign-finish-v1`, with independent
  gates whose status is `PASS`, `FAIL`, `UNKNOWN`, or `NOT RUN`.

Signal/control machine statuses are exactly `PASS`, `FAIL`, and `UNKNOWN`.
`UNKNOWN` blocks a required control; it never means false. Coverage conclusion
labels are exactly `exhaustive-over-declared-space`,
`sampled-over-declared-space`, `partial-interrupted`, `control-invalid`, and
`coverage-unknown`. Consumers should switch on those fields rather than parse
human reasons. Signal receipts deliberately contain no target instruction
text or target words; normal ledger redaction still applies to other
comparison detail.

The CV64 campaign record also uses
`decomp-workbench-recorded-example-v1`. That is aggregate historical metadata,
not a schema emitted by a CLI command and not a substitute for a fresh
comparison.

## Failure

A representative error is:

```json
{
  "schema": "decomp-workbench-error-v1",
  "command": "compare-dumps",
  "stage": "command",
  "status": 2,
  "error": {
    "kind": "not-found",
    "message": "..."
  }
}
```

Argument-parser failures follow the same envelope when `--json` was present.
`kind` is a small operational classification (`usage`, `not-found`,
`process-failed`, `timeout`, `no-result`, or `command-failed`); domain details
remain in the message or an optional `details` object.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|---:|---|
| `0` | command completed; any explicitly requested gate passed |
| `1` | a requested match/validation gate failed, or no usable rows existed |
| `2` | invalid input, missing capability, or failed external stage |
| `3` | the report was produced, but at least one `--census` predicate was false |

A failed required campaign control returns 2 because the experiment is
invalid and ordinary candidates were not scheduled. `campaign finish` returns
1 when it wrote a valid receipt with one or more evaluated gates failing, and
2 when it could not produce a trustworthy receipt.

State and readiness are data, not automatically process failures. For example,
successful partial `toolchain calibrate` returns zero with
`claim="uncalibrated"` and lists the missing gates. `toolchain status` returns
nonzero only when recorded file integrity fails.

## Bounded process output

Compiler-facing reports retain at most 64 KiB per stdout/stderr stream by
default and report original byte counts plus truncation. Use `--stream-limit`
to change the preview and `--artifact-dir` to retain complete streams. Artifact
filenames are exclusive and collision-safe; existing evidence is never
overwritten.

Compact campaign automation should prefer `--json-summary`. Full `--json`
includes richer compiler and instruction evidence. JSONL ledgers are
append-only; an unterminated torn final line after interruption is ignored with
a warning, while every newline-terminated malformed record is rejected.

## Files written by reports

Explicit exports and force specifications refuse to overwrite. Derived status
inside an owned `.decomp-workbench` state directory is updated atomically.
Cache prune is a dry run until `--apply`, and apply moves entries to recoverable
trash rather than deleting them.

These contracts are exercised in the supported Python matrix, macOS full-suite
CI, targeted Windows process/filesystem CI, distribution smoke tests, and
runnable documentation tests.
