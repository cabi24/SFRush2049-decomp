# Object comparison

Use comparison as a ladder: begin with broad structural signals, then require
exact instruction words once the candidate is close.

## Compare objects

```sh
decomp-workbench compare target.o candidate.o \
  --symbol function_name \
  --objdump /path/to/mips64-elf-objdump \
  --show-diff
```

For CI:

```sh
decomp-workbench compare target.o candidate.o \
  --symbol function_name \
  --fail-on-mismatch \
  --json > comparison.json
```

Every command that selects one function accepts `--symbol` and `--function`
as two spellings of the same option, because decompilation projects say
"function" and GNU tooling says "symbol". Passing both with different values
is an error rather than a silent last-one-wins.

`--fail-on-mismatch` returns nonzero unless the relocation-aware words and
relocation-kind layout match and every encountered type is understood. With an
explicit `--cross-rom`, structural equality is accepted for the command but
continues to report `exact=false`.

Every human-readable report starts with a verdict and next action. This is
intentional: `raw_word_mismatches` is evidence about literal instruction-word
identity, not an instruction-matching score. For example:

```text
verdict=instruction-exact aligned_total=   0 words=   0 raw=  48 ...
raw difference classes: relocation_controlled=48
raw-vs-words: raw=48 exceeds words=0 by 48 relocation-controlled word(s):
              linker-filled bits no source change moves. A raw objdump text diff counts
              them permanently, so words=0 is the honest gate, not a byte-identical dump.
next: Instruction-exact: raw differences are linker-controlled relocation fields.
```

The `raw-vs-words` note appears whenever `raw` exceeds `words`, because that
difference is the number a separately written disassembly diff will report and
cannot remove. A pair whose target names each literal with its own symbol and
whose candidate merges them into one anonymous section sits on such a floor at
every literal load.

This prevents a common late-stage failure mode: continuing to mutate source
solely because a UI or raw comparison reports a nonzero number after the object
oracle has already proved the instructions exact.

## Is the thing you compared the thing you just built?

A comparison answers "are these two objects the same". It does not answer "is
this object the thing my last edit produced" — and on screen the two are
indistinguishable. An operator confirming a match at ROM level got a silent
**0 differing words** from a `build/` image that had never been relinked after
the source edit. The false match survived several verify cycles.

So every comparison states its own provenance before the verdict:

```text
compared: target     build/target.o     built 2026-08-28T09:41:02Z
compared: candidate  build/track.o      built 2026-08-28T09:39:07Z
verdict=instruction-exact aligned_total=   0 words=   0 ...
```

That is the default, and it is the whole guard when nothing else is declared:
the timestamps are there for a reader to notice. Nothing was *checked*, so the
`--json` block says `status: unknown` with `comparisons: 0`; it never reports
`fresh` for a chain nobody declared. To have them *checked*, name
the inputs the compared artifacts were built from:

```sh
decomp-workbench compare target.o build/track.o \
  --symbol func_8001A154 \
  --built-from src/track.c
```

Every named input must be older than every compared artifact. If one is not,
the command refuses before it disassembles anything:

```text
error: candidate build/track.o was built 12m BEFORE source src/track.c was last
written (2026-08-28T09:27:11Z < 2026-08-28T09:39:07Z). A comparison against a
build older than its inputs measures the previous edit: rebuild, or pass
--allow-stale to say you meant this one
```

The refusal is the default because the failure it guards is a *false
positive*: a stale comparison does not look wrong, it looks like a match.
`--allow-stale` downgrades it to a warning printed above the verdict, for the
cases where a retained reference build is genuinely the intended input. The
same two options are on `compare`, `compare-dumps`, `diagnose`, and
`diagnose-dumps`, and `--json` carries the whole report as a namespaced
`staleness` block (`staleness_schema`), leaving the host document's own
`schema` alone.

### Checking a chain without running a comparison

A host wrapper that rebuilds a ROM and then compares can ask the same question
directly, in build order, earliest input first:

```sh
decomp-workbench check-staleness \
  src/track.c build/track.o build/game.elf build/game.z64 --sha256
```

Exit status is 0 when every artifact is at least as new as the inputs before
it and 1 otherwise, including when a path is missing — an unproven chain is not
a fresh one. Every *earlier* path is an input to every later one, not just to
the next: a ROM relinked after its object but before the source was recompiled
is stale against the source even though it is newer than the object it holds.
`--sha256` records a content hash per artifact so a wrapper that keeps the
report can tell a rebuild that changed something from a rebuild that changed
nothing.

In Python, the same report is one call:

```python
from decomp_workbench.staleness import staleness_report

report = staleness_report("src/track.c", "build/track.o", "build/game.z64")
if report.stale:
    raise SystemExit(report.message)
```

### What this cannot tell you

Modification time is evidence, not proof. A build that preserves timestamps, a
restored archive, or a moved clock can make a current artifact look stale, and
`touch` makes a stale one look current. Equal timestamps are deliberately not
staleness — a fast build genuinely writes an object in the same filesystem tick
as the source — so the default tolerance is one second and `--tolerance 0`
tightens it. The guard removes the *silent* case; the project's own build
system remains the thing that knows what is out of date.

## No verdict may suppress a diff site

The verdict chooses emphasis and the next action. It never filters evidence.
Every position where the instruction words or the relocation kinds differ is
reported as a *diff site*, classified but never dropped:

```text
verdict=allocation-mismatch aligned_total=   2 words=   2 raw=   2 ...
aligned residual classes: aligned_register=1, aligned_constant=1
diff_sites=2 (constant=1, register=1)

[   0] constant
       target    24020021  li $v0,33
       candidate 24020031  li $v0,49

[   1] register
       target    012a4021  addu $t0,$t1,$t2
       candidate 012a5821  addu $t3,$t1,$t2
```

The site count and class histogram always print; `--show-diff` adds the sites
themselves. Site classes are `constant`, `register`, `commutative-order`,
`opcode`, `operand`, `relocation-layout`, `relocation-controlled`, and
`instruction-count`. This is a policy, not a patch: a register-range summary
once hid a `li v0,33` versus `li v0,49` literal that the same report counted
in `raw`, and the omission scoped an experiment to two sites when there were
three. The invariant is covered by a test: every differing word is a site.

`diff_sites` and `diff_site_classes` carry the same evidence in `--json`.
`register_diff` remains for compatibility and is the register-classed subset.

When `--symbol` selects an assembly-defined symbol without an ELF size, GNU
objdump can include zero alignment padding through the end of the section. The
workbench excludes unreachable zero words after the function's final `jr ra`
delay slot; the delay-slot instruction itself remains part of the comparison.

## Verdicts and the next lever

A verdict names the cheapest mechanism that explains the residual, because a
verdict chosen by volume sends the next experiment to the wrong layer.

| Verdict | Recognized by | Next lever |
|---|---|---|
| `instruction-exact` | Masked words agree; raw differences are relocation-controlled | Verify the link or ROM; do not change source |
| `instruction-words-identical` | Raw words and relocation layout agree | Run the project's final verification |
| `unknown-relocation` | A relocation kind has no precise field mask | Add the mask before trusting the comparison |
| `relocation-layout-mismatch` | Instruction bits agree, relocation kinds/symbols differ | Translation-unit and linker context, not fake expressions |
| `constant-mismatch` | Every differing site is an immediate on `li`/`lui`/`ori`/`andi`/`addiu`/`slti` with equal opcodes and registers | Audit the flag/enum/constant against the assembly, then re-derive fakes |
| `commutative-order` | Every differing site swaps the two sources of a commutative operation | Compound assignment (`x \|= y`), not the allocator |
| `schedule-mismatch` | Equal instruction count and equal opcode multiset, reordered | Statement/expression grouping; `-g0` diagnostic; `replay-as1` |
| `structure-mismatch` | Opcode differences or an instruction-count delta | C and control-flow shape; check constant sites first when present |
| `allocation-mismatch` | Opcode shape agrees, registers differ | Live ranges, declaration order, allocator traces |
| `operand-mismatch` | Remaining immediate or offset differences | Inspect the localized sites |

When registers differ and the stack adjustments also disagree, the report keeps the
`allocation-mismatch` family but prints the frame delta before the residual and
names frame recovery as a separate acceptance gate. A lower normalized
register score never hides a wrong frame; inspect callee-save use, spills, and
source-local stack homes before treating that candidate as progress.

Three of these classes exist because volume-based naming misdirected real
campaigns:

- **`constant-mismatch`** — one wrong flag identifier produced 183 words that
  read as `structure-mismatch`. When a large structural difference starts at a
  constant materialization, the assembly encodes the truth; audit the constant
  before anything else, then re-derive fakes that may have been fitted to the
  wrong body.
- **`commutative-order`** — two `or` instructions with swapped sources were
  reported as `allocation-mismatch`, which dispatched allocator work for an
  expression-tree problem. IDO 5.3 canonicalizes `a | b` and `b | a`, so that
  family is dead; `x |= y` is a distinct expression tree and is the lever.
- **`schedule-mismatch`** — equal-length reordered output was reported as
  `structure-mismatch`. Under `-g3` IDO emits a `.loc` per statement and the
  assembler restricts motion across those barriers, so rebuilding the candidate
  with `-g0` is a high-value ownership probe. If the region collapses, debug
  metadata constrains the `-g3` schedule and as1 can reach the target ordering.
  It does **not** prove source correctness: a freer scheduler can rescue a
  non-original expression or statement shape.

A verdict never suppresses evidence; see the diff-site policy above.

### The two layout verdicts run the aligner for you

`structure-mismatch` and `schedule-mismatch` are the two verdicts a **block
permutation** lands on — the first when the move also changes the instruction
count or the opcodes around it, the second when the instruction multiset
survives the move intact. Both are verdicts on which `words` is actively
misleading, because `words` is positional: move a block and every row between
its old home and its new one is compared against a stranger. One campaign
candidate whose real edit script was a single relocated 29-row block reported
**1,791 differing words** and was ranked below strictly worse candidates.

So on those two verdicts, and only those two, `compare` runs the shift-tolerant
aligner itself and prints the result beside the positional count:

```text
verdict=structure-mismatch words=1791 opcodes=612 gaps=116 ...
layout (shift-tolerant edit script, run automatically on structure-mismatch):
  blocks=3 replaced=0 inserted=29 deleted=29 rows=1866->1866 (+0)
  rows_away=30 (30 edit + 0 residual) against words=1791
  moved blocks: 1 (29 row(s)) present in both objects at different positions
       29 row(s)  target 1204..1232  ->  candidate 887..915  (-317)
  A permutation is a block-order question, not a 1791-word one. Run `align`
  for the full script.
```

The same object is under `layout` in `--json`, with every moved block. When
`moved_block_count` is non-zero the `next:` guidance leads with it. When it is
zero the block says so — the difference is not a permutation, and the
positional counts are reading real changed code.

Blocks are matched on the `normalized` key (mnemonics, operand shape and
registers, addresses and immediates abstracted) and must be at least three
rows: verbatim text would refuse every real move, since a relocated block's
branch destinations change with it, and opcodes alone would call any two
similarly shaped runs a relocation. No other verdict pays for an alignment.

### Watch rows: a heal signature instead of a scalar

```sh
decomp-workbench compare target.o candidate.o --watch-rows r49=49,cx2=1620,sx3=1677
```

```text
watch rows (.=healed X=broken): 1 healed, 2 broken
  r49 cx2 sx3
  X   .   X
  signature=X.X
  [   49] r49: register
          target    addiu	t3,v0,-250
          candidate addiu	t3,v1,-250
```

A watchlist is a set of **positional rows you chose because they discriminate**
— the same coordinates `diff_sites[].index` and `--show-diff` print, so a row
number read off one report pastes straight into the next command. Each becomes
one column: `.` healed, `X` broken, `?` past the end of the comparison, which
is its own glyph so a candidate that lost the tail of the function cannot print
a clean signature.

This is not a distance and does not average. That is the point: in the
campaign it came from, a six-column signature was the fitness function that
converged after `opcodes` conflated schedule with allocation and `words`
over-charged a permutation (see [Trap 8](metric-traps.md)). `--json` carries
`watch_rows`, `watch_signature`, and the healed/broken/out-of-range tallies.
Every watch key is namespaced, `watch_schema`
(`decomp-workbench-watch-rows-v1`) included: the watchlist is merged into
whatever report asked for it, and the host document keeps its own top-level
`schema` — `decomp-workbench-comparison-v1` for `compare`, and so on.

The same option is on `compare-dumps`, on `rank` (one signature per ranked
row, under one header), and on [`sweep build`](sweeps.md) (the `sig` column of
the wave table). Bare rows label themselves (`--watch-rows 49,1620`);
`LABEL=ROW` names the columns; `@probes.json` reads a named set from a file,
which is what a durable campaign watchlist should be.

## One name per metric

The terminal label and the JSON key are the same string, rendered from one
registry entry. `words=` in the summary line is `"words"` in `--json`;
`insns=` is `"insns"`; `frame=` is `"frame"`. Print the whole registry with:

```sh
decomp-workbench --explain-keys
```

`--explain-keys` is also accepted by every command that reports comparison
metrics (`compare`, `compare-dumps`, `rank`, `compile-rank`, `campaign`), and
prints the table without running the command.

The previous JSON spellings — `word_mismatches`, `raw_word_mismatches`,
`normalized_distance`, `register_mismatches`, `fp_register_mismatches`,
`candidate_instructions`, `candidate_frame_size`, `candidate_sha1`, and the
other long forms listed by `--explain-keys` — **are deprecated but still
emitted beside the canonical keys for one release**. They carry identical
values. New consumers should read the canonical key; existing consumers keep
working until the next release removes the aliases.

This is a bug-class fix, not cosmetics: `words=` versus `word_mismatches` cost
debugging cycles in two recorded campaigns. A test asserts that every label
printed on the summary line resolves to a registry key and that both spellings
carry the same value, so the two surfaces cannot drift again.

## What the metrics mean

The table below uses the attribute names; the canonical short key for each is
in `--explain-keys`.

| Field | Meaning | Appropriate use |
|---|---|---|
| `raw_word_mismatches` | Positional 32-bit word differences before masking | Detect whether files are literally identical |
| `word_mismatches` | Positional differences after masking known linker-controlled fields | Final function-level matching oracle at zero; a tiebreaker above it |
| `aligned_total` | LCS-aligned differing rows a source change controls | Rank candidates against each other, but only where `aligned_gaps` is 0 on both |
| `aligned_insertions`, `aligned_deletions`, `aligned_gaps` | Aligned rows the aligner filled on one side only | Decide whether `aligned_total` may be compared with another candidate's at all |
| `alignment_comparable`, `alignment_caution` | Whether it may be, and the one-line caution when it may not | Gate an automated ranking |
| `aligned_structural`, `aligned_schedule`, `aligned_register`, `aligned_constant`, `aligned_commutative` | The aligned residual split by mechanism | See which lever family the residual belongs to before opening `view` |
| `opcode_mismatches` | Positional mnemonic differences | Distinguish structure from operands |

| `fp_register_mismatches` | Register differences involving `$fN` | FP allocation diagnostics |
| `instruction_delta` | Candidate instruction count minus target count | Structural basin |
| `target_true_instructions`, `candidate_true_instructions` | Real, unpadded instruction counts -- see "The true instruction count" below | The correctness screen to run before trusting anything position-based |
| `true_instruction_delta` | `candidate_true_instructions - target_true_instructions` | The padding-safe `instruction_delta`; can be nonzero when `instruction_delta` reads zero |
| `instruction_count_verified` | Whether both true counts were read from the objects' own ELF `.text` sections | Distinguish a byte-exact measurement from the disassembly-based fallback |
| `candidate_frame_size` | First `addiu sp,sp,N` adjustment | Stack topology |
| `candidate_stack_offsets` | Histogram of `N(sp)` operands | Spill and local-home comparison |
| `candidate_fp_register_uses` | Histogram of FP operands | Promotion/allocation comparison |
| `verdict` | Product-level classification of the evidence | Decide whether to edit source, trace allocation, or verify the link |
| `raw_difference_breakdown` | Why literal words differ | Separate instruction bits from relocation-controlled words |
| `relocation_target_mismatches` | Positional relocation symbol/addend differences | Explain why a linked-function match can still fail the local scratch-score proxy |
| `relocation_symbol_mismatches` | The subset of those where the two sides name a *different symbol* | Catch a candidate that reads a different variable while every masked counter reads zero |
| `diff_sites` | Every differing site with its class | Read the residual without the verdict filtering it |
| `diff_site_classes` | Count of differing sites per class | See the mechanism mix at a glance |
| `structural_exact` | Opcode, normalized shape, registers, frame, and count agree | Cross-ROM/compiler-lineage evidence only |
| `accepted` | Whether this invocation satisfies `--fail-on-mismatch` | Automation for `compare` and `compare-dumps` |
| `acceptance_basis` | `function-exact`, `cross-rom-structural`, or `mismatch` | Explain why the command accepted or rejected the comparison |

`instruction-words-identical` means the selected function's raw instruction
words and known relocation-kind layout agree. It does not claim that the whole
object file, symbol table, or final ROM is byte-identical.

## The true instruction count, and why the padded one lies

`target_instructions`/`candidate_instructions` (`insns=`/`target_insns=`) are
the number of instruction *words compared* -- however many words objdump
disassembled. That number can include trailing padding: MIPS `.text` sections
are padded to a 16-byte, 4-instruction boundary, so a function whose real body
is not itself a multiple of four instructions has alignment filler words after
it. A whole-section comparison (no `--symbol`) disassembles that padding along
with the code, so `target_instructions`/`candidate_instructions` count it too.

The trap: two functions of *different* real length can report the *same*
padded count. A target with a 4641-instruction body padded out to 4644 words,
compared against a candidate whose real body is exactly 4644 instructions
(needing no padding at all), reports `insns=4644` on both sides -- the padded
counts agree while the real lengths differ by three. A probe three
instructions too long once passed a campaign's gate exactly this way, and
every stage after it had to re-derive the true count by hand with:

```sh
mips-linux-gnu-objdump -d obj.o | grep -c '^ *[0-9a-f]*:'
```

That command works only because GNU objdump's *default* disassembly (no
`-z`) elides a long-enough run of trailing zero bytes as `...` instead of
printing it, so alignment padding never reaches the count -- but *this tool*
always passes `-z` (it needs every word, including zero ones, to keep
addresses and relocations aligned), so it cannot get the same answer by
accident.

`target_true_instructions`/`candidate_true_instructions` are the answer to
the hand command, without running objdump a second time or depending on which
flags happened to be passed. They are always populated:

- **Read from the object's own ELF `.text` section** (`instruction_count_verified: true`) whenever a real object file is available and the
  comparison is not narrowed with `--symbol` -- the same question the hand
  command answers, for the same reason (`compare`, `diagnose`, `rank`, `score`,
  `campaign`, and anything else that reads `.o` paths).
- **Derived from the parsed disassembly** with the identical rule otherwise
  (`compare-dumps`/`diagnose-dumps`, which have no object file to read, and
  any `--symbol`-narrowed comparison, where a whole-section ELF read would
  answer "how long is the section" rather than "how long is the symbol").

The rule, either way: find the *last* `jr $ra` in the measured range, keep its
one delay-slot instruction, and drop everything after it only if it is at
least two all-zero words. That "at least two" is measured, not assumed: GNU
objdump's default disassembly still prints a *single* trailing zero word as a
real `nop` rather than eliding it, so a section that happens to end in one
genuine trailing `nop` -- needing no alignment filler at all -- is not
touched. Trimming that word anyway silently drops one real instruction from
the count, which happened on a real campaign object before the threshold was
measured against a hand-assembled fixture and locked in a regression test.

`compare`/`diagnose` print a `warning:` line, ahead of everything else, only
when `target_true_instructions != candidate_true_instructions` -- the
condition that actually invalidates a positional or per-region reading.
Whenever either side's *true* count differs from its *reported* one (padding
was found at all, even if both sides agree), a `target padding:`/`candidate
padding:` line says so in the explanation, without raising it to a warning:
padding by itself is not a problem, a true-count *mismatch* is.

## Aligned counts, and why they rank

`words=` counts positions. An inserted or deleted instruction shifts every
later position, so a candidate one edit away from the target reports a long
cascade while a candidate with a dozen unrelated allocation differences reports
a short one. That inversion misranked candidates in six recorded campaigns; in
one, positional words ranked two variants identically at 95 words when the
aligned split (10 structural versus 8) picked the only one that composed with
the next edit.

## Check what an exact function changed around itself

A selected function can be raw-word and relocation-target exact while its
source adds static storage, changes GP linker metadata, or perturbs another
function in the same translation unit. Compare the full objects separately:

```sh
decomp-workbench object collateral reference-tu.o candidate-tu.o \
  --function function_name --fail-on-collateral
```

The report inventories section sizes—including zero-fill `.bss` that has no
bytes for `objdump -s` to dump—section contents, relocations, and symbols.
With `--function`, it reports selected-function exactness as an independent
fact. `classification=outside-selected-function` means the function passed but
the containing object did not. Debug, comment, and note sections are ignored by
default; repeat `--ignore-section GLOB` to declare additional project-specific
noise explicitly.

This is a translation-unit collateral gate, not a replacement for the normal
link/map/ROM verifier.

`compare` and `compare-dumps` therefore also report the LCS-aligned residual,
computed by the same analysis `view` renders — not a second aligner:

- `aligned_total` — the ranking number while every candidate is gap-free, and
  the sum of the five class counts;
- `aligned_structural`, `aligned_schedule`, `aligned_register`,
  `aligned_constant`, `aligned_commutative` — the residual split by mechanism.

Aligned rows classed `match`, `displacement` (an encoded branch offset that
moved because something was inserted between here and there), `relocation`
(a linker-supplied field), and `pool` (the same literal-pool slot reached
through a differently named anchor) are not in the total: none of them is a
difference a source change owns. `pool_layout` — a literal-pool access that
resolves to a different slot — is reported as its own class and verdict but is
also outside the total, because the difference lives in the data section rather
than in the compared function.

`pool_resolution`, `pool_matches`, `pool_layout_mismatches`,
`target_pool_slots`, and `candidate_pool_slots` report that reading beside the
counts. See [view.md](view.md) for the two resolution tiers and what each one
does and does not claim.

Alongside them, `gaps=` (with its `aligned_insertions`/`aligned_deletions`
split) reports the alignment's own edit operations. `aligned_total ==
word_mismatches` holds exactly when a candidate is a pure register renaming;
once the aligner has inserted a gap, the candidate is aligned against a
different subsequence of the target and its aligned total is no longer on the
same scale as another candidate's. `compare` prints a one-line `caution:` in
that case, ahead of the numbers it retracts.

When instruction counts and every positional opcode agree, the stronger
evidence wins: `alignment_method=positional-opcode` locks row N to row N and
bypasses LCS. This prevents repeated sibling blocks from manufacturing gaps
and false structure/constant guidance in a pure register-allocation residual.
Other shapes retain `alignment_method=lcs`.

Late-stage JSON also carries `pool_exact`, `pool_prefix_exact`,
`temp_prefix_exact`, `first_temp_divergence`, and `first_divergent_row`.
Prefix values are aligned object rows; `null` means that lane never diverged.

**What it costs.** The alignment is quadratic in the worst case and runs once
per comparison. Measured on a synthetic function with one inserted instruction
and one recolored register: 500 instructions 0.02 s, 1500 0.10 s, 3000 0.29 s,
for the whole comparison. Those are per-candidate costs against a compile, and
in that same 1500-instruction case the positional count is 1106 and the aligned
residual is 2 — which is the number the ranking needed.

For a fully comparable population, `rank`, `campaign`, and `compile-rank`
retain the aligned-residual ordering. When any comparison is unsafe on that
scale, automatic ranking uses **geometry Pareto layers**, then positional
words. Three smaller-is-better measurements define the layers:

- Absolute `true_instruction_delta`, using the existing padding-aware count
  scoped to the selected symbol or section, never substituting a full TU's
  section size for one symbol. `instruction_count_verified` still records
  whether counts came from ELF bytes or the disassembly fallback.
- The normalized edit-script distance already reported by `layout_summary`
  (or `normalized_distance` for comparisons without a layout summary).
- `opcode_distance`, a shift-tolerant opcode edit-script distance. Existing
  `opcodes` remains the positional count; it can cascade after an insertion
  just as `words` does.

A candidate dominates another only if all three measurements are no worse and
at least one is better. Nondominated candidates receive `geometry_front=0`;
remove that layer and repeat. Exact comparisons precede nonexact ones.
Positional words break ties within a layer. JSON names this order
`ranked_by: "geometry-pareto"`, exposes each comparison's `geometry` vector
and `geometry_front`, and retains all existing scalar metrics.

For example, a synthetic 1,208-instruction target with seven early insertions
has far more positional mismatches than one with nine late insertions. The
1,215-instruction candidate has better extent and edit evidence and ranks
ahead of the 1,217-instruction candidate. If one candidate instead improves
extent while worsening edits, both can remain on the same front: the display
order is not proof of progress. `--rank-by words` remains available on
campaign commands for an explicitly positional experiment.

The edit scripts use the existing `SequenceMatcher` heuristic, not an optimal
edit-distance proof. Layers describe only the current population and are
recomputed on resume. They do not establish semantic equivalence, source
reachability, or that a dominated candidate cannot compose with another edit.
Required signals and selected-region preservation remain ahead of geometry in
campaign ranking. Source retention keeps every candidate on the first front,
as well as prior leaders and exact results. Incomplete older ledger records
fall back to positional ordering with an explicit caution until remeasured.
`words=0` with `exact=true` remains the matching claim; linked-image and
relocation verification requirements are unchanged.

## Ask a question and read the exit code: `--census`

`compare`, `compare-dumps`, `view`, and `view-dumps` accept predicates over the
keys they already report:

```sh
decomp-workbench compare target.o candidate.o --symbol texDPTextures \
  --census aligned_register=0,frame=-128
```

```text
census: PASS aligned_register=0
census: FAIL frame=-128 (actual -96)
```

One `KEY=VALUE` per predicate, comma-separated, and `--census` may be repeated.
A comma only separates entries when what follows it starts another `KEY=`, so a
value that contains one — `verdict=mixed(constant:1, register:2)` — survives.

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0` | the report was produced and every predicate held |
| `3` | the report was produced and at least one predicate failed |
| `2` | the census could not be evaluated: bad syntax, an unknown key, a key this run did not produce, a non-scalar key, or a value of the wrong type |

`3` is deliberately not `1`. `--fail-on-mismatch` already answers with `1` and
means "this candidate is not a match"; the two questions are independent,
because a variant can be exactly the shape you are looking for and still not be
the match. When both are passed and a predicate fails, the status is `3`.

Any key the command reports can be named, including the deprecated JSON
spellings for as long as they are emitted; `--explain-keys` prints the list.
Keys whose value is a list or an object (`diff_sites`, `hunks`, `lanes`) are
refused rather than silently compared. Values are compared by the reported
type: `exact=true` reads a boolean, `frame=-0x80` reads an integer in any base,
`target_frame=none` reads a missing value, and a verdict compares as text.

Predicates are checked against the registry **before** the inputs are read, so
a misspelled key in a 2500-variant sweep costs one process, not one compile.
That is the point of the feature: campaign agents rebuilt this filter as an
objdump-and-regular-expression layer at least seven times in one day, and the
regular expression version keyed on the wrong thing at least once.

```sh
# Keep only the variants whose register residual is gone.
for object in build/variants/*.o; do
    decomp-workbench compare target.o "$object" --symbol texDPTextures \
      --census aligned_register=0 >/dev/null && echo "$object"
done
```

## Relocations

The workbench invokes GNU-compatible objdump with `-d -r -z`. At each aligned
instruction, it masks the union of fields controlled by known relocations on
either side:

- lower 16 bits for common `HI16`, `LO16`, `GPREL16`, `GOT16`, `CALL16`,
  TLS, and related instruction relocations;
- lower 26 bits for `R_MIPS_26`;
- all 32 bits for relocations such as `R_MIPS_32` and `R_MIPS_REL32`.

`R_MIPS_NONE` and `R_MIPS_JALR` do not mask instruction bits. An unknown
relocation is reported and prevents `exact=true`; the comparator does not
guess.

Relocation symbols and addends are recorded by the parser but are not part of
the verdict. `relocation_metadata_mismatches` reports positional differences
in relocation kinds and prevents `exact=true`. The relocation-aware word
metric remains useful when comparing an extracted/link-resolved target and an
unlinked candidate, but the report does not silently call unequal relocation
layouts exact.

`relocation_target_mismatches` separately compares kind plus symbol/addend
targets. It does not change generic linked-function exactness because two
spellings may resolve to the same linked address. `check-scratch` requires it
to be zero, together with raw instruction identity, for its local zero-score
proxy.
`relocation_target_differences` is the corresponding receipt: each record
includes the instruction and relocation indices plus both sides' instruction
offset, relocation offset, type, symbol, parsed addend, and original target
spelling. `check-scratch` prints these records directly, so a relocation-only
rejection no longer requires a second hand-written objdump parser.

### `words` is a floor, not a ceiling, once a relocation symbol differs

Masking a relocation-filled field out of `word_mismatches` is right when both
sides name the same object at a different addend, and wrong when they name
different objects. A candidate that loads `g_viOriginalHstart` where the target
loads `viMode` has the same instruction bits after masking, so it reports
`words=0 opcodes=0 gaps=0` while being a different function.

`relocation_symbol_mismatches` is the counter for exactly that half, and each
record in `relocation_target_differences` carries a `difference` field naming
which half moved:

| `difference` | Meaning | Source change indicated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `symbol` | The two sides name different symbols | Yes — a different variable is being read |
| `addend` | Same symbol, different link-time offset | No — the linker resolves it |
| `kind` | Same symbol, different relocation type | Usually — check the addressing mode |

Read a `words=` count on a comparison with a nonzero `relocation_symbol_mismatches`
as a **floor** on the remaining work: masking excluded every relocation-differing
row from it. A scan of `words`/`opcodes`/`gaps` alone cannot see those rows,
which is why `compare` prints a `relocation-symbol caution:` block ahead of the
summary line, reports `verdict=relocation-symbol-mismatch`, and refuses
`accepted` with basis `relocation-symbol-mismatch`.

Each record also carries `candidate_section_symbol`. It is true when the
candidate reaches an anonymous section offset (`.rodata+0x118`) where the target
names an object. That is the shape of a duplicated string literal or a privately
copied global: the instruction bits agree, but the translation unit grew its own
storage and every later object in that section shifts. The benign case — the
candidate naming a section offset that *is* the target's named object, with no
new storage — is distinguished by checking whether the translation unit already
defines that object.

### Linked-address aliases

Two equivalent endpoints can have different spellings: `array + count` in an
unlinked candidate and the next adjacent BSS/data symbol in a linked target.
Their final linked address may be identical even though their relocation symbol
or addend presentation differs. Treat this as a translation-unit/linker-context
question, not proof that the function's C needs a fake expression. The
workbench calls such a case `relocation-layout-mismatch`; verify the linked
object or final ROM before changing source.

### When the object comparison cannot be right at all

There is a case where no object-level verdict is available, however the
spellings are read. A module that ships **unrelocated** carries its own
relocation table and is patched by the game's runtime linker after it loads,
so the target's calls name placeholders that have no address in any build and
the candidate cannot reproduce them. `words` has a floor above zero that no
source change closes. The linked image is the only sound oracle there:
[The linked image as an oracle](linked-oracle.md) covers `reloc-surface`,
which supplies each placeholder's value from the shipped addends, and
`linked-compare`, which classifies the resulting image per function range.

## Compare retained text

`compare-dumps` accepts GNU objdump text directly:

```sh
decomp-workbench compare-dumps target.objdump candidate.objdump \
  --symbol function_name
```

This is useful for bug reports and tests because the text can be reduced to a
small redistributable fixture. When a dump contains several functions,
`--symbol` selects the exact objdump label. It uses the same relocation parser
and metrics as object comparison.

## Cross-ROM structural evidence

Projects with regional or revision ROMs can compare retained dumps or objects
with `--cross-rom`:

```sh
decomp-workbench compare-dumps jp.objdump us.objdump \
  --symbol function_name --cross-rom --fail-on-mismatch
```

This accepts `structural_exact`: equal opcode sequence, normalized instruction
shape, register operands, frame, and instruction count. It is useful evidence
that the source/compiler lineage is shared across ROMs even when linked
addresses, data offsets, and absolute immediates differ. It never changes
`exact=true`, and it must not replace project-level object or ROM matching.
JSON output makes the distinction explicit with
`"acceptance_basis": "cross-rom-structural"`.

## Ranking is not proof

Normalized distance intentionally hides information. A candidate can improve
instruction shape while worsening the scalar score, or hide a frame shift when
stack offsets are normalized.

For projects using asm-differ, keep its native score and penalty buckets beside
the workbench report. The workbench does not reproduce asm-differ’s alignment
or weights.

The final project gate should remain the project’s normal object or whole-ROM
verification, not a heuristic score.

## Before the metrics: length and phase

Two facts decide what the numbers above are numbers *about*, and both are
invisible to a position-indexed comparison. `align` reports the edit script
between the two streams, so an object that is one instruction longer reads as
"one instruction away" rather than as a four-figure cascade. `phase` reports
the scratch-ring coset per named row slot, so a residual that is a global
register renaming is never mistaken for a list of mistakes -- nor recorded as a
win on the quotiented number. See
[Shift-tolerant diffs and the ring phase](shift-and-phase.md).
