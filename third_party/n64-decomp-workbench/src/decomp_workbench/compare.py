    """Return aligned evidence, including late-stage prefix progress.

    Positional counting misranked candidates in six recorded campaigns: one
    inserted instruction shifts every later position, so a candidate that is one
    edit away reads as a long cascade and a candidate with a dozen scattered
    allocation differences looks closer.  The counts come from the ``view``
    analysis; nothing here re-implements the alignment.

    The gap counts come back beside them because they are the receipt for the
    counts: a row the aligner filled on one side only is a position the two
    objects do not share, and every such row is a reason not to read this
    candidate's aligned total against another candidate's.

    The fourth element is the literal-pool reading, which says how the two
    objects' pool accesses were resolved and how many slots each references.
    See :mod:`decomp_workbench.literal_pool`.

    The fifth is the commutative operand reading, which needs *every* aligned
    row and not only the reported ones: a swapped operand order in the source
    often leaves the arithmetic row byte-identical and shows up one row back,
    in the two operand loads. See :mod:`decomp_workbench.commutative`.

    script is *one relocated block* reported 1,791 differing words. Two
    campaign waves ranked such candidates below strictly worse ones on that
    number (`docs/history/postmortem-2026-08-24-cef4c-exact.md`, "What failed

    how many blocks the edit script has, how many of them are the same code in
