    The bridge between an instrumented compiler and the verdict a reader
    acts on. `view.ownership_for` answers the ownership question from two
    disassemblies and labels the answer a heuristic; this turns the same
    question into a measurement wherever a globalcolor trace exists, because
    the trace records the one fact the disassemblies cannot show -- whether
    the register was *taken* or merely *underpriced*.

    A declined force and a `regsleft=0` contest are the same finding through
    two instruments: the colour is not available, so no reweighting lever
    wins it, and a reader who spends the afternoon reweighting is spending it
    on a probe that was always going to decline.

    Scoped to `proc`/`web` when given, because a trace covers a whole
    compilation and a residual is one function's.
