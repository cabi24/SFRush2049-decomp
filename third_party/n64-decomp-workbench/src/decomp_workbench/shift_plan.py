"""The remediation queue: one ranked, gated list out of every shift report.

The dossier's third honest tension (``shiftability-research/DOSSIER.md`` §6)
is the one this command answers:

    "Findings must be classified by remediation, or the tool is noise. mk64
    proved the failure mode: an unbounded hand-labeling slog. The deliverable
    is not '10,000 address-shaped words' but a ranked queue where every
    finding carries: confidence (empirical > static), evidence, the symbol
    whose range the value lands in, remediation class -- and the verification
    gate to run after the fix."

``shift audit`` and ``shift rehearse`` each produce a report that is true and
neither produces a *plan*. The audit ranks how confidently a word is an
address; the rehearsal says which references a real relink moved; the symbol
census says which names it left behind. A maintainer holding all three still
has to decide what to do first, and the answer is not "read the highest tier"
-- it is "delete the eleven pins an object already defines, because that is
free and it is proven free".

Three properties shape everything here.

**Merged by subject, not concatenated by report.** pilotwings64's
``D_803571F0`` appears in four places: as an artifact-suspect pin in the
audit, as a `shadowing-pin` once the audit reads the ELF, as a
``stale-confirmed`` word in the rehearsal, and as a shadowing finding in the
symbol census. It is one job. `PlanItem` is keyed by ``(remediation,
subject)`` and carries every source that named it, so the queue's length is
the number of things to *do* rather than the number of times they were
mentioned.

**Ranked by what the evidence cost, then by what the fix costs.** Convictions
lead: a finding a real relink demonstrated outranks one a static scan
suspects, which is the DOSSIER's "empirical > static" in one sort key. Then
the free wins (`DELETE_REDUNDANT_PIN` -- S6 proved by ablation that deleting
a shadowing pin leaves the ROM byte-identical), then the mechanical
symbolizations, then the real work, then the parked structural classes. A
queue sorted by severity would put the overlay window at the top, where it
would sit unfixed for a year; sorted this way, a maintainer's first afternoon
closes a third of it.

**Grouped by owning section inside the working classes.** `MIGRATE_SYMBOL`
items sort by the section whose extent contains their value, because a
maintainer fixing eleven pins fixes them one *file* at a time -- pilotwings64's
split into four in ``.kernel`` and eight in ``.app``, which is two sittings,
not twelve.

Every item carries the exact command to run after the fix. That is the
difference between a queue and a list: a `MIGRATE_SYMBOL` item is
match-preserving, so its gate is ``shift config verify`` proving the rebuilt
link is byte- and symbol-identical; a conviction's gate is the same rehearsal
re-run with a ``--census`` predicate one lower than it is today. Nothing here
is a verdict about a project. It is a work order with receipts.

**Rules as data, and what the reports could not carry.** `REMEDIATION_CLASSES`
and `PLAN_RULES` travel inside every report. So does `plan_capped`: a report
whose detail lists were written at ``--limit 40`` cannot describe a fortieth
finding, and a plan built from it says so rather than quietly planning a
third of the work.
