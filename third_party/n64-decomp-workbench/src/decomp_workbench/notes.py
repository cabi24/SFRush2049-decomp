"""Append-safe notes for a shared findings log.

A campaign's improvement log is written by many agents at once, and the usual
guidance -- "append only, re-read the file first" -- is not a mechanism. It is
a request, and it cannot be honoured: between the read and the write another
writer's whole-file rewrite lands, and the second writer's copy wins with no
error anywhere. One campaign lost roughly twenty-six consecutive entries that
way, over eight stages, while every agent involved reported success honestly.
Each of them *had* appended. Each of them was then overwritten.

The fix has to survive a writer that does not cooperate, because that is the
writer that caused the loss. `flock` alone does not: it serializes the two
`open`/`read`/`write` sequences without stopping the second from writing back
a copy of the file that predates the first. So the durable record is never the
shared file. `note add` writes each note to its own new file under a sidecar
directory (:func:`notes_directory`), created with ``O_EXCL``, and never opens
the log for writing at all. A whole-file rewrite of the log cannot destroy a
file it does not touch, and two concurrent `note add` calls cannot collide
because neither reuses a name.

`note list` renders the merged view -- the log's own entries plus every
sidecar note not yet folded in -- so the sidecar is a staging area a reader
sees, not a directory that quietly fills up. `note merge` folds the pending
notes into the log with `flock` and ``O_APPEND`` (correct here, because the
merge is the one writer that does append rather than rewrite) and then moves
the merged files aside rather than deleting them: the note survives even if
the merge output is later clobbered by the same kind of writer this module
exists to defend against.

The contract this module owes its caller is exactly one sentence: *a note,
once written, cannot be lost by a concurrent writer.*
