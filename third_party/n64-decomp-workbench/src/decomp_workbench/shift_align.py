"""What an inserted instruction costs, as opposed to what it shifts.

``compare`` and ``score`` index by position: candidate row *i* is read against
target row *i*. That is the right model for a candidate the compiler emitted at
the target's length, and it is catastrophically wrong for one that is a single
instruction longer. Every row after the insertion is compared with its
neighbour, so an object that is byte-exact apart from one extra ``nop`` reports
a four-figure mismatch count and reads as garbage.

One campaign paid that cost eleven separate times before anyone wrote the
twenty-five lines that fix it, and two more stages independently rediscovered
the same gap. This module is those lines, generalized: align the two
instruction streams with :class:`difflib.SequenceMatcher`, report the edit
script (``replaced``/``inserted``/``deleted``) instead of a positional count,
and hand back the row pairing so a *scorer* can charge the shifted rows to the
rows they really correspond to.

Three properties this module holds that its campaign ancestors did not:

* **Two relocation spaces, never one.** A row whose word the linker fills
  cannot be compared, on either side. The campaign's scorers unioned the
  target's relocation rows with the candidate's into a single set and then
  tested *both* a target row and its shifted candidate counterpart against
  that mixed set, which over-masks near a shift boundary: two genuine
  mismatches were dropped from a published number that way. Here the target
  rows are masked by the target's relocations and the candidate rows by the
  candidate's, and the two sets are never mixed.
* **Branch destinations are renormalized through the pairing.** A local branch
  encodes an absolute row number, so an insertion above it changes the word
  without changing the code. The candidate's destination is mapped back into
  target row space before the two rows are compared, so a shift does not
  manufacture mismatches out of correct branches.
* **The cut list is derived, not supplied.** The banded scorers this replaces
  required a human to read an alignment and pass the insertion points by hand.
  The pairing here comes straight from the edit script, and
  ``insertion_only`` says whether the shift is of the compensable shape at
  all.
