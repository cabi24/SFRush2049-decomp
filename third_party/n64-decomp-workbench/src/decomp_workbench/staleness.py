"""Whether the artifact in front of you was built from the inputs beside it.

A comparison answers "are these two objects the same". It does not answer
"is this object the thing my last edit produced", and the two questions look
identical on screen: a ROM-level check against a `build/` image that was never
rebuilt reports **0 differing words** and reads as a match. That happened on a
real project. The false match survived until a fresh assembly of the target
disagreed, and the intervening verify cycles were spent proving something that
was never true.

Nothing here recompiles or rebuilds. It reads modification times -- and, when
asked, content hashes -- of artifacts named in build order, and reports the one
fact that is cheap to check and expensive to miss: a derived artifact that is
older than something it is derived from. The chain is the caller's to declare,
because only the project knows it: source -> object -> ELF -> ROM on one
project, a single object built from three fragments on another.

Two deliberate limits:

* mtime is evidence, not proof. A build that preserves timestamps, a restored
  archive, or a clock that moved can all produce a fresh artifact that looks
  stale, and a `touch` produces a stale one that looks fresh. That is why the
  escape hatch exists and why the hashes are recorded: a host that keeps a
  report can compare the *content* of an input across two runs and know
  whether the rebuild it is about to trust had anything to rebuild from.
* Equal timestamps are not stale. Filesystem timestamp granularity is coarse
  enough that a fast build genuinely produces an object in the same second as
  the source, and refusing on that would make the guard the thing operators
  routinely pass `--allow-stale` to get past.
