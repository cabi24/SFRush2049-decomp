"""Editing a source the way a composer must: the base named, the zones frozen.

Every stage of one campaign wrote its own source composer, and the difference
between the good ones and the bad ones was not cleverness. It was whether the
composer stated *which file it was written against* and refused to run when the
answer changed.

The strong ones (`don/mk.py`, `zed/mk.py`) opened with a whole-file SHA and a
list of named anchor lines, and died loudly when the base moved. The weak ones
(`redb/mk3.py`, `b4u/mk.py`) asserted the content of eight particular lines and
nothing else, so a rebase that shifted the file silently mis-edited it and
produced a plausible, wrong candidate that then had to be un-believed later.
One campaign lost a stage to exactly that.

So this module is the promotion of the strong shape, with the one weakness the
audit found in it removed. `don/mk.py` re-verified its anchors by searching the
*whole* emitted file for the anchor text, which a coincidental duplicate string
elsewhere would satisfy; here every anchor is re-read **at its own line**,
through the line map the edits themselves produced.

Three refusals, in the order they fire:

* **the base moved** -- the file's SHA-256 is not the one the plan was written
  against, so no line number in the plan means what it meant;
* **an anchor moved** -- the line is there but does not say what the plan
  expected, so the edit would land on someone else's statement;
* **the edit is in a frozen zone** -- another stage declared those lines
  protected, and a composer that quietly edits them is how two stages'
  constructions get silently merged.

What it does not do is judge whether the edit is *meaningful*. That is
:mod:`decomp_workbench.csource`'s and the reviewer's job. This module makes the
edit land where it was aimed, or not at all.
