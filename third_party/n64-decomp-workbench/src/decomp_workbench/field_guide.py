"""The field guide as a runtime resource, and the on-ramp off every verdict.

A community member ran `diagnose`, got a correct `register-permutation`
verdict with a `playbook=forced-color-oracle` footer, and wrote back: "this
looked cool, but no idea what im meant to do next".  The analysis was right and
the reader was still stranded, because every noun in the footer -- playbook,
forced color probe, instrumented toolchain -- was a concept with no address.
The project's own field guide answers all three, and no terminal output had
ever mentioned it.

This module closes that gap from both ends:

* `next_steps` is *data*, not a parse.  Diagnosis must never depend on a
  Markdown file being readable, so the verdict-to-lever index is transcribed
  here as a table of numbers and one-line actions.  A lever the shipped guide
  does not carry still gets its one-liner.
* `sections` is the parse, used only by `decomp-workbench guide`, which is the
  command the footer now tells the reader to paste.  The guide travels inside
  the package so an installed wheel can print it with no checkout.

The two halves are deliberately independent.  The table is the promise; the
document is the elaboration, and losing the document degrades the promise to a
one-liner rather than to silence.
