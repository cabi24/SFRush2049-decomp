"""Drive decomp-permuter over a queue of functions with scratch fidelity.

Every host that runs decomp-permuter at campaign scale re-invents the same
batch loop, and each re-invention re-introduces the same three faults that
make a search answer the wrong question:

1. **The scratch searches the wrong ISA.** decomp-permuter's importer
   defaults to ``-mips1``; a project that builds ``-mips2`` then gets a
   search whose every candidate is compiled for a target the real build
   never emits. Recovering the flags from ``make -n <object>`` fixes it,
   but only if the source is touched first: ``make -n`` prints nothing for
   an up-to-date object, so the naive recovery silently recovers nothing.
2. **The scratch object is not the real object.** A translation unit whose
   build applies a post-compile ``objcopy`` (``--redefine-sym`` and
   friends) produces a scratch object the real link would never accept, so
   a score of zero in the scratch does not transfer.
3. **The score is normalized.** Without ``--stack-diffs`` the scorer
   normalizes stack offsets and reports zero for a spill at the wrong
   slot.

This module is the parser and the policy for those three, plus the queue
mechanics (closest-first ordering, resume, load gating, the score-trend
extension) around them. It executes decomp-permuter; it does not decide
what a result means, and it deliberately stops short of *promotion*:
splicing a winner into a project's source and proving the byte-identical
rebuild is host-specific, and belongs in the project's own repository
where the authoritative build lives.
