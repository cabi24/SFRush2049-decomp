"""Ring phase as a vector over named row slots, with its coset always declared.

A late-stage float-heavy function is often not "wrong" so much as *rotated*:
the compiler allocated the same values to the same scratch ring, starting at a
different register. Whole regions then differ in every row while being one
renaming away from exact. Two campaign habits grew up around that, and both of
them lie in a way that costs stages:

**Quotienting silently.** A band scorer that reports the best-fit permutation's
mismatch count prints a small, encouraging number for an object that is
positionally enormous. One campaign's headline "39 -> 29" was really 1045
positional rows once the ring had rotated globally, and the tool that printed
it never said so. Here a slot's quotiented count is never printed bare: it
carries the coset that produced it, and the positional count beside it, and
when any slot is non-identity the report says in words that the two numbers
measure different things.

**Naming bands that do not cover the object.** The scorer family this replaces
partitioned a 4641-row object into eight named ranges that between them left
105 rows unnamed, so a mismatch landing in the gap was absent from the total --
one candidate scored ``RAW=1`` with two real mismatches. Slots here are
*checked* to partition the row space exactly: a hole or an overlap is an error
that names the rows, not a convention the reader is trusted to maintain.

Two further properties follow from the same idea that a phase is a vector, not
a number:

* the state is one coset **per slot** -- eight named sub-zones of one campaign's
  object each rotated independently, and a single global permutation cannot
  express that;
* a slot with too few rows whose match status depends on the coset has *no
  evidence* about its phase, and is reported as ``no-evidence`` rather than
  being assigned the first permutation that happens to win. Classifying a
  small slot in isolation is how one campaign dropped a working construct from
  every catalogue it kept.

Scoring is shift-tolerant by construction: rows are paired through
:mod:`decomp_workbench.shift_align`, so an inserted instruction moves the
comparison rather than destroying it.
