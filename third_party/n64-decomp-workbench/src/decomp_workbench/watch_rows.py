"""A fixed watchlist of rows, rendered as healed/broken columns.

Scalar metrics answer "how far", and on a layout-shaped candidate they answer
it badly. One campaign's endgame had six rows that discriminated between the
mechanisms actually in play -- an integer ``addiu`` at row 49, four
floating-point temp assignments, one selector -- and the number that predicted
progress was not ``words``, ``opcodes`` or ``regs`` but *which of those six
were healed*. ``opcodes`` conflated schedule with allocation; ``words``
over-charged a block permutation by three orders of magnitude. The six-column
signature did neither, because it is not a distance at all: it is a per-site
truth table over sites the reader chose because they discriminate.

That watchlist was carried in an ad hoc scorer, retyped into three successive
shapes, and never available from the product. This module is it::

    r49 cx2 sx3 tm2 tm1 f1
     .   X   .   X   X   .

``.`` healed (the row does not differ), ``X`` broken (it does), ``?`` out of
range (neither stream has that row -- reported rather than silently counted as
healed, because a shortened candidate would otherwise print a perfect
signature).

Rows are *positional* indices into the comparison, the same coordinates
``diff_sites[].index`` and ``compare --show-diff`` use, so a row number read
off one report can be pasted into the next command without translation.
