"""Versioned JSON reports and structured command failures.

The terminal and JSON interfaces answer the same questions, but JSON has an
additional durability obligation: a caller must always receive one parseable,
schema-named document when it explicitly asks for JSON.  Command handlers stay
focused on domain behavior; :func:`run_json_handler` supplies the common
envelope without hiding programming errors or changing non-JSON behavior.
