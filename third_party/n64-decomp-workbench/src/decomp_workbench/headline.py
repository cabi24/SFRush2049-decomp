"""One honest number for "how far is this candidate from the target".

The workbench reports three counts for one comparison, and they disagree:

``words``
    Positional word differences after masking linker-controlled relocation
    fields. It is the function-level matching oracle -- ``words=0`` is the
    match -- and it is the only one of the three that means the same thing
    for two different candidates.
``raw``
    Every differing word, including the ones whose only differing bits are
    relocation-controlled. On a pair whose literal pools are spelled
    differently it can never reach zero, so it *inflates*.
``aligned_total``
    LCS-aligned rows a source change would have to move. The right question
    about one candidate and the wrong question about two: once the aligner
    inserts gaps, a differently scheduled object realigns against a different
    subsequence and its row count can fall below a strictly better
    candidate's, so it *under-reports*.

None of that is wrong, and all of it was already printed. What was missing was
a default. Every stage of one campaign had to be told which number to trust,
and one of them spent 257 builds building a lever table ordered by the wrong
one. So this module picks: the headline is ``words``, always, and the other
two appear beneath it labelled with what they are for. When they disagree,
the disagreement is stated as a numbered fact with its cause, rather than left
for the reader to notice.

The score stays positional words. Structural search additionally needs extent
and edit evidence; automatic campaign ranking considers their Pareto layers.
