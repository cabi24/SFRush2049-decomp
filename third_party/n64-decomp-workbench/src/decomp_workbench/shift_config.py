"""The faithful-cascade gate: does a config change leave the link alone?

Making a project shiftable means editing its linker configuration, and the
one thing that edit must not do is change the build. S6 made pilotwings64
shift-capable with a single yaml line (``follows_vram: kernel`` on the ``app``
segment, ``s6/PW64-SHIFT-CONFIG.md`` §1.5) and then had to prove the claim
before any rehearsal of it meant anything. That proof is Gate 2, and the
doc's own playbook line is the reason this module exists:

    "the identity gate is three checks, not one. A byte-identical *image* can
    coexist with a symbol that moved into a hole; ``nm -n`` diff is what
    closes that. Run all three."

`shift config verify` is those three checks as one command.

**Check 1 -- every shared symbol at an identical address.** The movement
audit :func:`~decomp_workbench.ldmap.audit_symbol_movement` already
generalizes S0's, and a faithful pair is exactly the case where the only
allowed delta is ``0``. This is the check that catches a symbol that moved
into a hole the image's own bytes cannot show.

**Check 2 -- identical placed extents.** Every output section must land at
the same VMA, with the same size and the same ``AT()`` load address. A pair
that agrees on symbols but disagrees on a section's placement is not the same
layout; it is two layouts that happen to share their symbol table.

**Check 3 -- byte-identical images, when both are given.** The cheapest check
and the weakest, in that order. It is optional because a caller comparing two
*maps* out of a config experiment often has no images yet, and asking for
them would push the gate later than it needs to run.

What this command refuses is as important as what it passes. Handing it a
genuinely shifted pair -- S0's DKR ``nm-base`` map against its ``shift-0x10``
relink -- must be loud, not quiet: that pair is a correct, healthy shift, and
"faithful" is simply not the question it answers. The report names the first
divergence of each kind in address order rather than dumping thousands of
rows, because the first one is the one a reader debugs.

Exit status follows the census contract (:mod:`decomp_workbench.census`):
``0`` when the pair is faithful, ``3`` when it is not, ``2`` when the
question could not be asked at all.
