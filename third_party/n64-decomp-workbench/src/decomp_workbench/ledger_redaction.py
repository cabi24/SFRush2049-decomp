"""Keep the target ROM's instruction text out of ledger files.

A campaign compares candidate objects against a *target* object built from a
game's ROM. The comparison that goes on screen quotes both sides -- that is the
point of the tool, and it happens on the operator's own machine against their
own legally dumped ROM. The ledger is different: it is a file, files get
committed, and committed files get pushed.

That is not hypothetical. Two ``ledger.jsonl`` files from a Mickey's Speedway
USA campaign reached a public remote with 126 diff-site records apiece, each
carrying ``"target": "addiu\\tsp,sp,-64"`` and ``"target_word": "27bdffc0"``.
Between them they were enough to reconstruct 129 of one function's 146
instructions verbatim. Removing them took a history rewrite.

The gap was architectural, not clerical: the ledger's schema *asked* for the
target's disassembly, so writing a correct ledger and leaking the ROM were the
same act. This module closes that by redacting at the ledger's serialisation
boundary, so:

* the in-memory :class:`~decomp_workbench.model.Comparison` is untouched, and
  every renderer, report and diagnosis keeps showing the full diff;
* nothing that reaches a *ledger* can be turned back into instruction text.

**This module covers the ledger, not every file the tool can write.**
``--html`` on ``view`` and ``diagnose`` renders target assembly rows into an
HTML report (see :func:`decomp_workbench.html_report.render_diagnosis_html`),
and ``force_spec`` records ``target_register`` for each aligned web. Both are
the same class of hazard. They are meaningfully better placed than the ledger
was -- they happen only when the operator asks, at a path the operator names,
rather than automatically into the project tree on every campaign run -- but
neither is covered here, and a consuming project's clean-room gate should be
what stops them being committed.

**And be exact about what "recursive default-deny" means here**, because it
has been overstated before. The sweep is recursive over *containers* and
default-deny over *field names*. It enters dicts, lists, tuples, sets and
frozensets to any depth up to :data:`MAX_DEPTH`, examines mapping keys as well
as values, matches target-naming keys case-insensitively, and re-sweeps the
values of keys it allow-lists. It does **not** read string contents: a target
instruction stored under an innocuous key name, or as a bare list element,
survives. That is a documented residue, not an oversight, and it is the reason
ledgers stay gitignored.

What survives redaction is what the ledger is actually *for*: per-site
bookkeeping. Which sites differ, how many, of what class, and whether the
target at a given index is still the same one it was on an earlier run. What
does not survive is any way to read the ROM out of it.

Three mechanisms, in order of how much they give up:

``target_digest``
    A **16-bit** salted digest of the target word (or, where there is no word,
    of its assembly text).

    The salt is load-bearing, and an earlier version of this docstring was
    wrong to say otherwise. The argument it made -- "every digest has ~2^16
    preimages in the 32-bit instruction space, so the salt need not stay
    secret" -- assumes an attacker with a *uniform* prior over instruction
    words. At a diff site that assumption is false, because the record
    deliberately retains ``candidate`` and ``candidate_word`` in full. Knowing
    the candidate narrows the target to a small set of plausible variants (the
    same instruction with a different register, a different immediate), and
    against a set of size n a known-salt digest is an exact-match confirmation
    oracle with roughly n/65536 false accepts. For small n that is recovery,
    not obfuscation.

    So the two mechanisms defend against two different attackers, and both are
    needed. The **salt** defends against the narrow prior: without it no digest
    can be computed at all, so no candidate can be tested. The **16-bit width**
    defends against the uniform prior: even with the salt, a site whose target
    is not constrained by anything leaves ~2^16 possibilities. Widening
    :data:`DIGEST_HEX` would give away the second defence entirely -- do not.
    And treat the salt file as sensitive: a leak of ledger *and* salt together
    puts target recovery at diff sites back on the table.

    Being per-ledger, the salt also means identical instructions in two
    campaigns do not produce identical digests, so no rainbow table spans
    ledgers.

``target_opcode_masked``
    The instruction word with every operand field zeroed -- primary opcode
    only, plus the ``funct`` selector for SPECIAL and the ``rt`` selector for
    REGIMM. It names the *kind* of instruction and says nothing about which
    registers or which immediates. Emitted for at most
    :data:`MASKED_OPCODE_SITE_LIMIT` sites per list, because a cap is what
    keeps "a few opcodes, for orientation" from becoming "an opcode sequence",
    which is most of a disassembly.

``target_register_count``
    Register-class sites recorded the target's register *names*. A sequence of
    register sets is operand data; its length is bookkeeping. Only the length
    survives.

The candidate side is never redacted. It is the operator's own compiler output
from their own C, it is what makes the ledger useful for ranking attempts, and
it is not the ROM's.
