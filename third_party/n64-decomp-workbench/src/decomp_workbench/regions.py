"""Attribute differing words to the source constructs that emitted them.

Every campaign rebuilds this by hand, and it is the single most repeated
manual step in a late-stage investigation: "which source lines own these
rows". The answer has to come out of an object with no debug information, so
it comes out of the one signal such an object still carries -- its call
relocations.

The mechanism
-------------
A direct call to a symbol the assembler could not resolve leaves an
``R_MIPS_26`` relocation carrying the callee's *name*. Read in ascending
section offset, those relocations are the object's call sequence. Scanning the
C source for call expressions gives a second sequence, in file order. Aligning
the two *by name* pairs object offsets with source lines, and each pair is an
anchor. A differing word is then reported as lying between the two anchors
that bracket it.

Three decisions make this honest rather than merely plausible.

**The object is ground truth and the source is a hypothesis.** The source-side
scan is a regex, and a regex cannot tell a call from a macro, a declaration,
or a cast. It does not have to. Only the *alignment* is trusted: a spurious
source-side name has no matching relocation, falls out of the alignment, and
is discarded. That is what lets a cheap scanner be safe.

**Ambiguity is dropped, not guessed.** Text order and emission order disagree
whenever a call is nested -- ``f(g(x))`` reads outer-first and emits
inner-first. Those pairs are dropped from the anchor set and counted, rather
than force-matched into a wrong line. One real campaign lost 14 of 318 anchors
exactly this way, and reported 304 rather than pretending to 318.

**The answer is a bracket, never a point.** Instruction density per source line
varies by an order of magnitude -- a ``sqrtf`` call is two instructions, a
matrix build is two hundred -- so interpolating a line number between two
anchors would be fabrication. A row that falls between calls sixty lines apart
gets a sixty-line answer, and the report says how wide its brackets are.

What this cannot do
-------------------
Calls to ``static`` functions in the same translation unit, and calls the
compiler inlined, emit no relocation and therefore no anchor. Stretches of the
object built entirely from them are bracketed only by whatever calls surround
them, which can be far away. That is reported as coverage, not hidden.

And ranking by count is not the same as ranking by work: when the two objects
disagree on instruction count, every branch immediate after the divergence
differs mechanically. Fourteen of one campaign's forty-two "constant" rows
were that shadow, and would have vanished for free from one upstream fix. The
report says so whenever the counts differ, because a ranking that presents
shadow rows as a top region is worse than no ranking.
