"""Reading a campaign directory that never had a manifest.

`campaign status` answers a good question well, and it is a different question:
its unit is a compiled candidate in a manifest `campaign run` itself wrote. A
late-stage campaign does not look like that. Its artifacts are files a human
promoted by hand, its floor came from a sweep in another directory, and its
residue is a `compare --by-region` run against a source path nothing records.
Asked for a one-screen "where are we", the honest options were to invent a
second notion of "campaign" -- a registry of tracked artifacts with provenance
-- or to leave the question unanswered. Both were wrong, and the second one won
by default for a while.

**The decision this module makes: no registry.** Nothing is persisted, so
nothing can be stale, and the two questions the design note left open stop
being questions:

* *Is an artifact's identity its object hash or its source path?* Neither is
  fixed here. A survey is a reading of the directory as it is right now: a path,
  and its content hash taken at read time. There is no stored identity to be
  wrong about.
* *Is "not yet attributed" a property of the residue or of the campaign's own
  records?* Of the residue, necessarily, because there are no records. The
  survey names the newest source and object it found and prints the command
  that measures them; it does not remember an answer.

The third open question -- "a second campaign is what would settle the schema"
-- is closed by there being no schema to fix. This reads only documents the
workbench already defines: findings logs and their sidecars, sweep manifests,
instrument-gate stamps, and `campaign run`'s own manifests. Everything else is
counted, not interpreted.

And it never guesses which artifact is "the base". Guessing is what a registry
would have institutionalised.
