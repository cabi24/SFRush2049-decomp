"""Orchestration for `permute-sweep` and `permute-doctor`.

`permute.py` holds the parsers and the policy; this module is the part that
actually starts processes: import one function into a scratch whose recipe
matches the real build, run decomp-permuter under a wall-clock cap, and
record what came back. Nothing here interprets a result, and nothing here
promotes one: a scratch score of zero is a candidate, and proving it on the
authoritative build belongs to the project that owns that build.

    function under test at all -- a "match" it would report instantly and

    With ``target_object`` there is a fourth question, and it is the one no
    amount of searching recovers from: can this scratch even *name* what the
    target calls. In a module that ships unrelocated the target spells every
    call with a placeholder the runtime resolves, so the score has a floor
