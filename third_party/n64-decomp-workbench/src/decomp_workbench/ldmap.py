"""Read a linked project's symbols: from its ``ld -Map``, and from its ELF.

S0's hand rehearsal (``shift-instrumentation/s0``, DKR ``us.v77``) proved the
whole shiftability-audit concept by hand before any of this existed: shift a
cascade linker script, relink, and diff the two images with a linker map open
in the other window. Every step of that hand process read the map text with a
throwaway regex -- once to find where ``.text`` of ``entrypoint.s.o`` ended
(the insertion point), once to resolve ``gRaceCheckFinishChecksum`` to a ROM
offset (a checksum-patched word's location), once to build the
address-to-symbol table the residue dump attributed unexplained words
against. This module is that regex, done once and tested, so the commands
that follow (``shift audit``, ``shift rehearse``) start from one parsed map
instead of each growing its own.

Four things this module has to get right that a naive "extract addr + name"
scan does not:

* **The VRAM<->ROM mapping is derived, not hardcoded.** DKR's cascade linker
  script (``mods/dkr.custom.ld``) places every segment but ``.main`` by
  chaining ``__romPos``; the only sections whose ROM position differs from
  their runtime address print ``load address 0x...`` in the map, because
  that is exactly when the section's script used ``AT()`` (``.main``,
  ``.main_bss``, ``.assets_lut``, ``.assets`` in DKR -- the two asset
  segments are DMA'd from ROM on demand and are never VRAM-resident at link
  time, which is also why ``.assets`` and ``.assets_lut`` share a VMA start
  with each other: neither one is really "at" that VRAM address
  simultaneously). A section that prints no load address is *not* assumed to
  have LMA == VMA here: GNU ld's real default LMA for such a section is
  "contiguous after the previous section's LMA in the same region", which
  can differ from VMA in a script this module has not seen. So
  :meth:`LdMap.rom_for_vram` / :meth:`LdMap.vram_for_rom` only resolve
  addresses inside a section that declared ``AT()`` explicitly, and return
  ``None`` rather than guess elsewhere.
* **A shared VMA start is not always the same shape.** DKR's
  ``.assets_lut``/``.assets`` pair (above) is one section genuinely nested
  inside another. An N64 overlay group -- several output sections a cascade
  script places at *one* shared VMA as mutually exclusive runtime
  alternatives, never resident together (Banjo-Kazooie's
  ``.CC``/``.GV``/``.MMM`` and eleven more all start at ``0x803863f0``, each
  with its own distinct ``AT()`` load address) -- looks identical from
  extents alone. :meth:`LdMap.section_containing` / :meth:`LdMap.rom_for_vram`
  / :meth:`LdMap.vram_for_rom` cannot tell the two apart and always resolve
  through the smallest candidate, correct for nesting and arbitrary for an
  overlay group; :meth:`LdMap.sections_containing` /
  :meth:`LdMap.sections_loaded_at` hand back every candidate instead of
  picking one, for a caller that needs the honest answer.
* **A symbol name is not unique across a map.** The cascade script
  reassigns ``__romPos`` once per segment as it walks the image, so the raw
  symbol stream holds it dozens of times at different addresses. A caller
  that asks for a symbol *by name* (the movement audit, a ``--census``-style
  lookup) wants the placement the map ended with, not an arbitrary one --
  the same last-write-wins rule the S0 spike's own ``census.py`` used (a
  plain ``dict`` built by iterating the symbol lines in order), which is
  what let its movement audit report "``main_BSS_END`` moved by 0x10"
  without qualifying which of the map's many ``main_BSS_END``-shaped lines
  it meant.
* **The linker's own location-counter updates are not symbols.** A line like
  ``. = ALIGN (., 0x10)`` shares a symbol line's exact shape -- an address
  followed by ``NAME = expression`` -- but ``.`` is not a name a caller can
  look up, and keeping it would collide every alignment padding in the map
  under one key and break every name-keyed lookup this module offers.
* **Tiling gaps are reported, not raised.** A gap between two input-section
  extents is sometimes real (an unaccounted hole) and sometimes ``. =
  ALIGN`` filler that the map prints as a separate ``*fill*`` pseudo-record
  this parser does not carry as an input section. Deciding which is a job
  for the caller, with the symbols around the gap in evidence --
  :func:`audit_tiling` hands back the coordinates and nothing more.

**The ELF half (WB-143).** A linker map answers "what name is at what
address" and nothing else. S6's pilotwings64 experiment
(``s6/PW64-SHIFT-CONFIG.md`` §4.4) needed three more facts per symbol, and
none of them is printable in a map: whether a name is *object-backed* (owned
by a real output section) or *absolute* (``SHN_ABS`` -- a linker-script
assignment, which by construction cannot follow a layout), what the symbol's
**size** is, and what its **type** is. `parse_elf_symbols` reads exactly
those out of the linked ELF's ``.symtab``.

The size field is the one that turned a hand experiment into a rule. When a
linker-script assignment overrides an object's definition of the same name --
splat's ``undefined_syms_auto.txt`` writing ``D_803571F0 = 0x803571F0;`` over
the ``.bss`` object that already defines it -- GNU ld emits **one** symbol,
typed ``SHN_ABS``, and *keeps the overridden definition's ``st_size`` and
``st_type``*. So an absolute symbol carrying a non-zero size is an absolute
symbol that shadowed a real definition, and that is visible in the shipped
link with no ablation, no rebuild and no second ELF. Measured on pw64's
37-pin ``undefined_syms_auto.txt``: exactly the ten pins S6 proved redundant
by ablation carry a size (4 to 5,168 bytes), and the other twenty-seven carry
zero. See `ElfSymbol.shadows_definition`.

Parsing rather than shelling out to ``nm`` is a deliberate choice with one
decisive reason: ``nm``'s default output does not carry ``st_size`` at all,
which is the discriminator above. The flags that would print it
(``--print-size``/``-S``) differ between GNU binutils and the llvm ``nm`` that
ships on macOS, and either way a subprocess makes the answer depend on which
cross-toolchain happens to be on ``PATH`` at audit time -- for a command whose
whole point is reading a build somebody else produced. The parse is
~60 lines of `struct`, has no dependency beyond the standard library, and is
tested against a handcrafted ELF built byte by byte in the test module.

This module reads ELF32 big-endian bytes with its own minimal struct code, and
so do :mod:`decomp_workbench.elf_symbols`,
:mod:`decomp_workbench.elf_instructions`, :mod:`decomp_workbench.line_probe`,
:mod:`decomp_workbench.objdump`. Each answers one narrow question and each
declines rather than raising where a general reader would refuse the file.
:mod:`decomp_workbench.elf` is the intended future home for all of them;
folding them in changes five distinct failure behaviours, so it is deliberate
work rather than a refactor to do in passing.
