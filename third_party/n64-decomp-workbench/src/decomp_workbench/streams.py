"""Record-level surgery, windows, and diffs for IDO's two phase streams.

The two streams a late campaign actually holds in its hands are the binary
Ucode uopt hands ugen and the fixed 16-byte Binasm ugen hands as1.  They are
decoded by :mod:`decomp_workbench.ucode` and :mod:`decomp_workbench.binasm`;
this module is the small amount of shared machinery that makes them *editable*
evidence rather than only readable evidence:

* one unified record view, so a window or a diff reads the same for both;
* fresh-label allocation, so an inserted control-flow record cannot collide
  with a label the stream already owns;
* record-framed insertion, replacement, and deletion that refuses to write a
  stream the decoder cannot read back.

Every edit here is a *sufficiency* experiment. Proving that an inserted record
produces the target object establishes what the downstream pass does with that
record. It never establishes that a C spelling survives the earlier passes and
emits it -- that claim needs the source-level work the record only points at.
