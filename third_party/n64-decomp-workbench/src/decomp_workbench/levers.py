"""The source edit a residual's evidence supports, or the proof there is none.

`diagnose` names the mechanism, the owning pass, and how close a source edit
gets to it. It stops one step short of the thing an analyst actually types.
Across 22 Mickey's Speedway USA targets with measured work on 2026-09-02/03,
four residual classes closed ten -- six exact, four proved unreachable -- and
in every one of them the distance between the verdict on screen and the edit in
the file was a piece of arithmetic somebody did by hand, from evidence the tool
already held or could read from a trace it already parses.

This module does that arithmetic, and only that arithmetic:

* **`stack-home`** reads the frame pair and, when a CDX frame ladder is
  supplied, the declared-local count. Homes descend from the frame top in
  declaration order, so a displaced home is a *position in the declaration
  list*, and a frame delta is a *count*.
* **`temp-ring`** reads the `DKWB_UGEN_TRACE` free-list records, which carry
  ugen's current source line, and reports pops per line against the target's
  temp lane. A pop is bought and sold by three known constructs.
* **`line-order`** reads the `DKWB-EMIT-V1` emit-provenance records and the
  line-order conflicts already computed from them, which name the pair as1's
  minimised line key decides and the join that removes the separation.
* **`pool-rotation`** / **`pool-population`** retain historical diagnostic
  labels for the two pool lanes' assignment sequences. Their lengths count
  emitted definitions, not distinct allocator webs. Neither equal nor unequal
  lengths prove coloring population or source reachability; that needs CDX
  records and per-input reservation evidence.
* **`unreachable`** carries the four proofs that closed a target by ruling it
  out, so the next analyst does not spend a day re-deriving one. Three are
  catalogue entries keyed on the owning pass; the fourth, as1 readiness, is a
  *measurement* when a `cc -Wa,-R` trace is supplied, because the deciding key
  of a selection says outright whether the line lever can reach it.

**The honesty rule, and it is the whole design.** A class is named from
evidence or not at all. Where the deciding input is a trace nobody captured,
the report says which trace, in the command that captures it, and leaves
`edit_family` null. Guessing an edit family from a residual's shape would
reproduce exactly the failure this module was built from: `overlay40UpdateEntries`
was recorded "not reachable by statement placement" on 2026-09-02 by an analyst
with four regressed variants and no emit trace, and matched the same day once
the trace existed. The verdict was a false floor, and it was manufactured by
answering a question the evidence had not been asked.

    The order is the order of decisiveness, not of frequency. An as1 trace
    settles the line question outright, so it is read first; a frame delta is
    an arithmetic fact about two prologues and needs nothing; a ring rotation
    and a line-order conflict each need their own trace and say so.

    `source` is the candidate's C, split into lines. It is not a trace and it
    decides nothing on its own: it is read only to check whether the line a
    ring trace charged holds the construct a pop-cost rule was measured on.

    `cdx_log` is the same file `--ladder` reads, read for its colouring
    records rather than its itable: a colour-only residual is owned by one of
    two sweeps that order their webs differently, and nothing in two
    disassemblies says which. `force_result` is a recorded `CDX_FORCE`
    experiment, which answers a different question again -- whether the
    target's assignment is legal at all -- and is never inferred from the
    absence of one.
