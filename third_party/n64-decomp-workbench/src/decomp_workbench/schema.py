"""One registry of comparison metric identities.

Human output and JSON output are rendered from the same tuple, so a printed
label can never drift from the JSON key that carries the same number. Two
recorded campaigns lost debugging cycles to ``words=`` in the terminal versus
``word_mismatches`` in ``--json``; naming both from one entry makes that
divergence structurally impossible.

The canonical name of a metric is its printed label *and* its JSON key. Where
a JSON key used to be spelled differently, the old spelling remains available
as a deprecated alias emitted alongside the canonical key for one release.
