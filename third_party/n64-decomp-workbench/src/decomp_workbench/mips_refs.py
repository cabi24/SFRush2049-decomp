"""Resolve %hi/%lo address arithmetic and classify the words a shift moved.

S0's hand-rolled census (a ~180-line spike run against a live DKR image --
see the shift-instrumentation campaign's S0-RESULT.md) surfaced two
properties either of which breaks a generalized resolver that does not model
them explicitly.

**Signed %lo wraps into %hi.** IDO's assembler does not split an address at
the 16-bit boundary; it splits the low 16 bits off as a *signed* add
immediate and folds the borrow into the high half, so ``%hi(addr)`` is one
greater than ``addr >> 16`` whenever ``%lo(addr)`` is negative. An insertion
that nudges an address across that boundary can move ``%lo`` between
``0xFFF0`` and ``0x0000`` while its paired ``lui`` -- correctly -- does not
move at all: naive splitting misreads that as two unrelated changes. The
signed arithmetic here (``hi16_for``/``lo16_for``/``compose``) is what keeps
the pairing legible. S0 hit this exactly once, at
``__CSPPostNextSeqEvent+0x25c`` (DKR us.v77, ROM ``0x0bccd8``), and a naive
``addr >> 16`` split would have reported it ``unexplained``.

**Value-first classification misattributes text.** A word whose full 32-bit
value happens to move by exactly the shift delta is not necessarily a data
pointer: a ``%lo`` immediate in a ``lw``/``sw``/``addiu`` whose displacement
did not sign-wrap moves by the *same* amount and is numerically
indistinguishable from a pointer, from the value alone. S0's own spike
classified value-first for the whole image and, by its own account, "absorbs
simple %lo immediates whose word-delta equals delta" into an abs32 bucket
that is honest about its count but not about what the words are. This module
classifies by *section* first -- decode a text word before ever comparing
its value -- which is the fix S0's own writeup called for. Run against the
same DKR image, this reclassifies most of that bucket: see
``build_word_census``.

Everything here reads raw big-endian words, never a disassembly: the whole
point of a shift census is to run before a candidate compiles, often against
retail bytes with no debug information at all.
