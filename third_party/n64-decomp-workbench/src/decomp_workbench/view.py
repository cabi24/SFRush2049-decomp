"""Aligned mechanism view: LCS alignment, class lanes, and hunk taxonomy.

Positional diffing lies.  One upstream register-role swap on a live campaign
function turned into roughly 76 phantom scattered differences under positional
comparison; the LCS-aligned truth was roughly 43 hunks.  Every count produced
here is therefore an *aligned* count, never a positional one.

The pipeline is two passes of ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` (``autojunk=False``
is mandatory: instruction streams are full of repeats that the junk heuristic
would discard), plus a classification step:

1. Anchor on the normalized instruction *text*.  Identical text is
   interchangeable, so these anchors carry no ambiguity.
2. Inside each unmatched region, pair by *opcode*, so an operand-level
   difference is classified rather than shown as a deletion beside an
   insertion.  Anything left unpaired is structure or schedule.
3. Classify every pair: register, commutative-order, constant, relocation,
   displacement, or match.

The ad-hoc aligners three campaigns built in one day ran the opcode pass
first.  That order cannot resolve a run of repeated opcodes -- eight ``addu``
instructions with one inserted among them align position by position, and four
correct instructions are then reported as register differences beside a
phantom insertion -- so the text pass anchors first here.

Register lanes are extracted from the *whole* aligned stream, including the
instructions that match.  That is not an optimization: the decisive signal in
the modLoadAnimActual campaign was in the temps that matched, and a view that
only shows mismatched instructions hides the queue.
