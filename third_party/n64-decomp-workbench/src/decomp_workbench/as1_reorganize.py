"""IDO 5.3 `as1 -R`: the scheduler trace the assembler already ships.

`instrument-scheduler` exists because the workbench assumed a scheduler trace
had to be patched in: a project-owned, hash-pinned profile against generated
`as1` C, behind five calibration gates. For IDO 5.3 that whole apparatus is
unnecessary. `as1` carries its own list-scheduler trace behind the `-R`
(reorganize) option -- option-table index 13 of the 106-entry table `f_which_opt`
reads -- and `cc` forwards it:

```
cc -Wa,-R ...          # trace on stderr, object byte-identical
```

It is print-only. The campaign that found it gated the claim rather than
asserting it: an object built with `-Wa,-R` was `cmp`-identical to the same
object built without it, whole file, not merely section-scoped. There is no
instrumented binary to hash-pin because there is no patch.

The trace is *richer* than `DKWB-SCHED-V1`, which is why this module reads it
natively and converts rather than the other way round. It carries the whole
per-block DAG -- `before`, `aftercycles`, `maxhazard`, successor latencies --
where the schema carries one selection per line. The schema also has no field
for the **losing** candidates, so `tie=` cannot be read out of it; it has to be
computed here, from the key chain, while the losers are still in hand.

The key chain, decoded from the selection driver and confirmed against 2688
recorded selections:

    ( start_time, -besttime, -aftercycles, -latency, node->addr,
      node->lineno, ready-list position )

lexicographic minimum, each step a strict accept / not-equal reject. The
`lineno` key is a **source physical line number**, which is the whole reason
this reader is worth having: it makes statement folding a codegen lever.

`besttime` outranks `aftercycles`, and is *not* the outright primary key.
Both halves are measured: a recorded block picks `aftercycles=0` over
`aftercycles=1` on the higher `besttime`, and the shipped
`examples/traces/as1-reorganize.log` contains a selection that `besttime`
alone decides the wrong way. Direction of each key: `start-time` and `lineno`
are **minimised** (lower wins), `besttime`, `aftercycles` and `latency` are
**maximised** (higher wins). The direction matters because `lineno` is the
one key with a source lever attached.

Two honest gaps, both reported rather than papered over:

* **`node->addr` is not in the trace per candidate** -- only the chosen node's
  `at %x`. In the calibrated compile it was 0 for every node in the translation
  unit, so the chain reduced to five keys; this reader evaluates those five and
  says so in the report's `proof`.
* **as1 has no cycle counter in the record.** `cycle=` here is the selection
  ordinal within the block, which is what the schema aligns two traces on.
