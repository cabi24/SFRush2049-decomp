"""Objdump discovery, invocation, and parsing.

GNU objdump prints relocations on a line following the affected instruction.
The parser makes those relocations part of the instruction model so comparison
can ignore only linker-controlled fields instead of broadly masking every
immediate.

This module writes ELF32 big-endian bytes with its own minimal struct code,
and so do :mod:`decomp_workbench.elf_symbols`,
:mod:`decomp_workbench.elf_instructions`, :mod:`decomp_workbench.ldmap`,
:mod:`decomp_workbench.line_probe`. Each answers one narrow question and each
declines rather than raising where a general reader would refuse the file.
:mod:`decomp_workbench.elf` is the intended future home for all of them;
folding them in changes five distinct failure behaviours, so it is deliberate
work rather than a refactor to do in passing.
