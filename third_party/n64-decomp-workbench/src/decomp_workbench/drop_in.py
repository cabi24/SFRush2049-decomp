"""One instrumented `cc` carrying both passes' traces, planned and audited.

Every instrumented-compiler question this workbench answers belongs to one of
two passes, and the two are instrumented from different generated sources:
uopt's CDX allocator profiles (`instrument-uopt`) and ugen's free-list and
emit-order hooks (`instrument-ugen`). A drop-in that carries only one of them
answers only half the questions -- and it does so silently, because a missing
profile is not an error, it is an empty log.

That is not hypothetical. A campaign rebuilt its drop-in for a ugen spike, the
rebuild reproduced only ugen, and the uopt CDX profile was gone from the
binary. `CDX_LOG=1` produced no file. The gap survived four separate lever
agents over two days, each of whom re-derived it from an empty log, and it
blocked four functions whose residual was an allocator tie -- exactly the class
CDX decides directly.

So this module does two things, and the second matters more than the first:

* :func:`plan` writes the reproducible two-profile recipe -- which generated
  source each profile is applied to, in which order, with which hash gate, and
  which fidelity check closes it -- as a manifest and a runnable script.
* :func:`audit` reads the *built* binaries back and reports, per profile,
  whether its gate strings are present. A profile that did not survive the
  rebuild is then a failed check rather than a week of empty logs.

The audit is a byte scan and needs no compiler, no build, and no ROM. It
cannot prove a profile *works* -- only the fidelity gate and a positive
microcase do that ([Principle 5](principles.md)) -- but a profile whose marker
is absent from the binary is definitely not there, and that one-sided claim is
what was missing.
